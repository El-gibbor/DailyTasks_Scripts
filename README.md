## Scripted Daily Tasks  
This repository contains Python and Bash scripts that automate some of my repetitive daily tasks, such as: 
- Git operations (`git add`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull`).  
- Creating programming files by selecting the language, inserting necessary header files, making the file executable, and opening it in my preferred editor (vim).  
- Automating MySQL server login by checking if the server is running, starting it if needed, and prompting for user credentials.  

Feel free to use and modify these scripts to suit your needs or add more functionality.
